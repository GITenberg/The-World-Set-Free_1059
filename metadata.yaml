description: "The World Set Free is a novel written in 1913 and published in 1914\
  \ by H. G. Wells. The book is based on a prediction of nuclear weapons of a more\
  \ destructive and uncontrollable sort than the world has yet seen. It had appeared\
  \ first in serialised form with a different ending as A Prophetic Trilogy, consisting\
  \ of three books: A Trap to Catch the Sun, The Last War in the World and The World\
  \ Set Free.\nA frequent theme of Wells's work, as in his 1901 nonfiction book Anticipations,\
  \ was the history of humans' mastery of power and energy through technological advance,\
  \ seen as a determinant of human progress. The novel begins: \"The history of mankind\
  \ is the history of the attainment of external power. Man is the tool-using, fire-making\
  \ animal. . . . Always down a lengthening record, save for a set-back ever and again,\
  \ he is doing more.\" (Many of the ideas Wells develops here found a fuller development\
  \ when he wrote The Outline of History in 1918-1919.) The novel is dedicated \"\
  To Frederick Soddy's Interpretation of Radium,\" a volume published in 1909.\nScientists\
  \ of the time were well aware that the slow natural radioactive decay of elements\
  \ like radium continues for thousands of years, and that while the rate of energy\
  \ release is negligible, the total amount released is huge. Wells used this as the\
  \ basis for his story. In his fiction,\n\nThe problem which was already being mooted\
  \ by such scientific men as Ramsay, Rutherford, and Soddy, in the very beginning\
  \ of the twentieth century, the problem of inducing radio-activity in the heavier\
  \ elements and so tapping the internal energy of atoms, was solved by a wonderful\
  \ combination of induction, intuition, and luck by Holsten so soon as the year 1933.\n\
  \nWells's knowledge of atomic physics came from reading William Ramsay, Ernest Rutherford,\
  \ and Frederick Soddy; the last discovered the disintegration of uranium. Soddy's\
  \ book Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt praises The World Set Free. Wells's novel\
  \ may even have influenced the development of nuclear weapons, as the physicist\
  \ Leó Szilárd read the book in 1932, the same year the neutron was discovered. In\
  \ 1933 Szilárd conceived the idea of neutron chain reaction, and filed for patents\
  \ on it in 1934.\nWells's \"atomic bombs\" have no more force than ordinary high\
  \ explosive and are rather primitive devices detonated by a \"bomb-thrower\" biting\
  \ off \"a little celluloid stud.\" They consist of \"lumps of pure Carolinum\" that\
  \ induce \"a blazing continual explosion\" whose half-life is seventeen days, so\
  \ that it is \"never entirely exhausted,\" so that \"to this day the battle-fields\
  \ and bomb fields of that frantic time in human history are sprinkled with radiant\
  \ matter, and so centres of inconvenient rays.\"\n\nNever before in the history\
  \ of warfare had there been a continuing explosive; indeed, up to the middle of\
  \ the twentieth century the only explosives known were combustibles whose explosiveness\
  \ was due entirely to their instantaneousness; and these atomic bombs which science\
  \ burst upon the world that night were strange even to the men who used them.\n\n\
  Wells observes:\n\nCertainly it seems now that nothing could have been more obvious\
  \ to the people of the earlier twentieth century than the rapidity with which war\
  \ was becoming impossible. And as certainly they did not see it. They did not see\
  \ it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands [...] All through the\
  \ nineteenth and twentieth centuries the amount of energy that men were able to\
  \ command was continually increasing. Applied to warfare that meant that the power\
  \ to inflict a blow, the power to destroy, was continually increasing [...]There\
  \ was no increase whatever in the ability to escape [...]Destruction was becoming\
  \ so facile that any little body of malcontents could use it [...]Before the last\
  \ war began it was a matter of common knowledge that a man could carry about in\
  \ a handbag an amount of latent energy sufficient to wreck half a city.\n\nWells\
  \ viewed war as the inevitable result of the Modern State; the introduction of atomic\
  \ energy in a world divided resulted in the collapse of society. The only possibilities\
  \ remaining were \"either the relapse of mankind to agricultural barbarism from\
  \ which it had emerged so painfully or the acceptance of achieved science as the\
  \ basis of a new social order.\" Wells's theme of world government is presented\
  \ as a solution to the threat of nuclear weapons.\n\nFrom the first they had to\
  \ see the round globe as one problem; it was impossible any longer to deal with\
  \ it piece by piece. They had to secure it universally from any fresh outbreak of\
  \ atomic destruction, and they had to ensure a permanent and universal pacification.\n\
  \nThe devastation of the war leads the French ambassador at Washington, Leblanc,\
  \ to summon world leaders to a conference at Brissago, where Britain's \"King Egbert\"\
  \ sets an example by abdicating in favor of a world state. Such is the state of\
  \ the world's exhaustion that the effective coup of this \"council\" (\"Never, of\
  \ course, had there been so provisional a government. It was of an extravagant illegality.\"\
  ) is resisted only in a few places. The defeat of Serbia's \"King Ferdinand Charles\"\
  \ and his attempt to destroy the council and seize control of the world is narrated\
  \ in some detail.\nBrought to its senses, humanity creates a utopian order along\
  \ Wellsian lines in short order. Atomic energy has solved the problem of work. In\
  \ the new order \"the majority of our population consists of artists.\"\nThe World\
  \ Set Free concludes with a chapter recounting the reflections of one of the new\
  \ order's sages, Marcus Karenin, during his last days. Karenin argues that knowledge\
  \ and power, not love, are the essential vocation of humanity, and that \"There\
  \ is no absolute limit to either knowledge or power.\"\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
